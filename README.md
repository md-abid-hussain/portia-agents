# PortiaAgents

PortiaAgents is a purposeful collection of AI agents built with the **PortiaAI SDK** during **AgentHack 2025** organized by **WeMakeDevs**. It unifies dayâ€‘toâ€‘day assistance, deep research, and documentation intelligence into one calm, coherent experience.

## What it is

A home for multiple AI agents, each designed for a distinct job:

* **ðŸ’¬ Chat Agent** - For quick, natural conversations that can tap tools when needed. Great for brainstorming, summaries, and fast Q\&A.
* **ðŸ”Ž Research Agent** - For deeper work: exploring the web, mapping sources, extracting key facts, and assembling findings with traceability.
* **ðŸ“š Documentation Assistant** - For instant, contextâ€‘aware answers from docs, READMEs, and knowledge bases.

## Why it exists

Switching tabs and mental modes slows you down. PortiaAgents reduces the friction by giving you:

* **One place, many workflows** - Move from chat â†’ research â†’ docs without losing context.
* **Clarity over noise** - Results emphasize citations, relevance, and actionable next steps.
* **Momentum for builders** - Designed around the rhythms of product work, learning, and shipping.

## What you can do with it

* Turn a vague idea into a first draft via **Chat Agent**, then deepen it with **Research Agent**.
* Pull precise information from your repos or docs using **Documentation Assistant**.
* Keep a lightweight research trail with sources you can revisit or share.

## Who itâ€™s for

* **Developers & builders** needing fast context switches between ideation, research, and implementation.
* **Students & selfâ€‘learners** who want clear, sourceâ€‘backed answers.
* **Teams** standardizing how they ask questions, gather evidence, and document outcomes.
